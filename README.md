# PAMAP2_analysis

## This project focuses on a basic analysis of the **PAMAP2 dataset** (using files from the `Protocol` folder, excluding the `Optional` folder). 

The analysis includes the following tasks:

1. **Determining the Percentage of Rows with NaN Values**  
   - Identifying the proportion of rows containing missing values (`NaN`) in the dataset.

2. **Pie Chart of Activity Distribution**  
   - Visualizing the volume of each activity in the dataset using a pie chart.

3. **Subject-Specific Analysis**  
   - Calculating the average heart rate for each subject across different activities.
   - Determining the average temperatures from the IMU sensors (chest, leg, and ankle) for each activity and subject.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is the **PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset**, available at:  
[PAMAP2 Dataset on UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/231/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring)
